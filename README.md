# PyFixer

PyFixer is an AI-powered CLI tool designed to streamline fixing common syntax and runtime issues within Python files. To do this it analyzes Python files by compiling them to check for any errors, then uses Perplexity.ai to fix these.

## Usage
Pre-Requisite: Will need a Perplexity.ai API key to use the tool.
```sh
./pyfixer.sh                             # On first run will build the gradle distribution
                                         # Subsequent runs will an start interactive session
./pyfixer.sh [path to python file]       # Will start analyzing and attempt to fix this file

./pyfixer.sh --rebuild                   # Included if gradle application needs to be rebuilt
```
